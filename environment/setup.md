# LLM Environment Setup

This environment is used for LLM experiments and projects.

## Tools
- Python 3.x
- Virtual environment (venv)
- pip
- cursor

## Setup Steps
1. ### Create venv
   You can use powershell or command prompt that depends on the terminal you're using. You open your terminal and go to your project root directory, you clone your github (when you open your repo you see code, click there and copy the link to the repo)
   and write this in your terminal "git clone link_to_repo"

2. ### Install cursor
When done installing cursor, go to your project folder and open cursor then check if you have "uv" by writing this in cursor terminal "uv --version", if you don't have uv go to "astral uv" in google chrome, there you will see installation for uv. Read the steps then you copy the link to uv
either windows or macOS. Copy the link and paste it in your cursor terminal, when installation finished close terminale and open a new one then check for uv by writing "uv --version", if you see a version then write
"uv sync" if not then restart your pc.

## Why Separate Environments
- Avoid dependency conflicts
- Keep practice and projects clean
